# Hospital Utilization Analysis
Analytics refers to the process of analyzing data using quantitative and qualitative techniques to identify patterns and trends. There are many ways healthcare management measures its performance, but one of the important ones is the patient's length of stay.

When hospitals are able to predict the length of stay (LOS), their treatment plans can be optimized to reduce LOS, in turn reducing infection rates among patients, staff, and visitors.

Project Highligths:

Hospital admission data were analyzed to determine the Length of Stay at the time of admission so that the hospitals can better manage their resources by building the Na√Øve Bayes algorithm, an ensemble method XGBoost and a dense neural network with 6 layers which yields an accuracy of 43% in python.
